In code we are using FRC Team 8575's MK4I template for drivebse. Thanks for your all support team 8575, Harrison!
Subsystems developed by GFROCE 9028 software subteam.
The drivebase same as TUAK event but unfortunately we have some plans to change the drivebase.
Using MK4I L2 SDS Modules, 8 NEO BRUSHLESS Motor and Navx2 For gyro.
We have 27:1 reduciton elevator powered by 2 NEO BRUSHLESS Motor.
We have 200:1 reduction wrist system powered by 1 NEO BRUSHLESS Motor.
Using encoder values for automated scoring and go to specific positions for scoring.
In this code we are currently switch to full automation for elevator and wrist.
